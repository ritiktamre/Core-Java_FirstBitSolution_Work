# Java = java is a independent programming language.java is a high level object oriented programming language 
that is used for building software application across various platform. java it was invented in 1995 by 
james Goshling.

#keys features in java.
- Platform Independent.
- Robust and secure.
- Multi-threading.
- Automatic memory management.
- object oriented.

Java are these types.
1.JDK, 2. JRE, 3.JVM.

1. JDK = Jdk it stands for java development kit.java development kit is used to java Applications is known as
  Java Development Kit.

2. JRE = JRE it stands for Java Runtime Environment.Java Runtime Environment is used to run java Application is
 known as Java Runtime Environment.

3. JVM = JVM it stands for Java Vertual Machine.Java Vertual machine is used to run java program is called as 
  Java Vertual Machine.

@ Function = functions is connected as behaviour.
 a.Functions needs are all sensible value.
 b.function can not need Explicit call.
 c.function needs implicitly Automatically calls.
 d.functions needs all sensible value function does not needs default value.
 e.functions which gets calls each and every objects will checks.

@ Constructor = Constructor is a special function which gets implicitly automatically call at the time of
 object creation is known as Constructor.constructor which gets calls each and every object will check.

 = Constructor are used to initilize the object implicity automically.
 = Constructor has same name as the same class.
 = Constructor does not have returntype void even.

# Constructor are two types.
1.Parameter Constructor = Parameter Constructor is a constructor which initlize the no of parameter is called as 
Parameter constructor.

2.Default Constructor = Default Constructor is a Constructor which does not take any parameter is called as
 Default Constructor. 

# Setter and getter = 
- Setter = Setter is used to set the value is called as setter.(Mutators).
- Getters = getters is used to assign the value is called as Getters.(Inspectors,Accesors)

@ Name Mangling = Namemangling means Discriptor.
 a.java does namemangling thought for function overloading and vice versa.
 b.Namemangling are used to internally change the function name at compile time.

@ Function Overloading = Function overloading is considered as Signature.it happens function name,must be
 same and number of parameter must be different.
 a. No. of Parameter must be different.
 b. Datatype of the parameter must be different.
 c.sequence of datatype of the parameter must be different. 

@ SDLC = SDLC it stands for Software development lifecycle. software development lifecycle is used to 
 test design, devlop is called as Software development lifecycle.

 Key phases of SDLC
 - Platform Independent.
 - Implementation.
 - Deployment.
 - Optimization.

 SDLC Models are the four types.
 - V- Models.
 - Spirial Models.
 - Waterfall Models.
 - Anglie Models.

 @ Abstraction Function = Abstraction function is a function which has a decleration does not have a
 defination is known as Abstraction function.
 
 - Abstract function must be overhideen.
 - Abstract class must be inherited.
 - Abstract function are non-Concret function.

 # Why Abstract function = Abstract function is a incomplete class.Abstract function is not create object.
   Abstract is all works for Sub-class.

 @ Interface = Interface means Pure- abstract function.all the functions of interface are purely abstract
 function is known as interface.
 
 Interface are four types.
 - Constraints.
 - Is Like a (Implements).
 - Code Security.
 - multi-type compectible.

why Interface = Interface means purely abstract class.interface is a incomplete class. interface is not
 create a object, but interface is multi inheritance support and 100 % abstraction.

 @ Static Varible = - Static variable means one for a class. 
 - Static variable get memory with the class loader by class loaded.
 - static variable get change the value with the particulaer object of a class.
 - static function are recommended access to static variable.
 - static variable get initilize using static block.
 - static block get ID has execution.
 - static function are non-overhidden function.

 Why Static variable = static variable means one data is allow all employees.

 @ Static Block = static block is a block of code get runs ones with a class loader by a class loaded 
 is called a static block.it is used to initilize the static block.

 @ Final Variable = final variable must be used for final attributes,final class,final methods(Functions).
 - Final Attributes = final Attributes can not be changed.
 - Final Class = Final Class can not be inherited.
 - final methods = final methods can not be overhidden.

 # why Final Variable = Final variable means agar humne kisi value ya data ko final variable se initilize 
 kiya h toh aap usko kabhi bhi change nhi kr skte isliye hum sab final variable ka use krte h.

 @ IDE = IDE it stands for Intregerated Development Environment.Intregerated Development Environment is 
 exactly used in text Editors,java compilers,and console-user Interface (CUI).

 @ Class Loader = class loader are the three types.
 1. Extension = Extension means Library.
 2. Built-in = Build-in means Boot Strap.
 3. Applications = Applications means our class path.

         
                        Class Loader
                       /      |      \        
                      /       |       \
                  Extension  Build-in   Application
                    |         |             |
                    |         |             |
                  Library    Boot Strap   Our Class Path

@ Package = Package is used to name-conversion and access-modifier is called as package.
 - one package is a multiple class.
 - one package is only one class is public.
 - one package is not multiple class is public.
 - jab hum kisi class ko public krte h toh ussi time class ka name and file ka name same hoge 
    but maindiatory nhi h ki same hoge.

 @ Wraper Class = Each primitive datatypes has it own relevant wraper class. wraper class means aap kisi 
 class ka name int nhi likh skte aapko Integer likhna hoga is called as Wraper class.

   int - Integer.
   char - Charecter.
   double - Double.
   float - Float.

 
 @ DownCasting = Downcasting means converting into a super class reference into a sub-class reference
 is called as downcasting.

 # Why downcasting = 
   super-class reference = super class reference is used by super method.
   sub-class reference = sub class reference is used by sub method.

  super class method ko sub class reference ko use krna h toh downcasting krna hoga. 

  Ex = Employee e1 = new Salesmanager();
       Employee e2 = new Admin();

      if(e1 instanceof Salesmanager)
        Salesmanager s1 = (SalesManager).e1;

     if(e2 instanceof Admin)
      Admin a1 = (Admin).e2;

 # Exception Handling = Exception handling means run-time problem.

                      objects
                         ^
                         |
                         |
                 ----->Throwable <------ Error
             |
             |
          Exceptions ------------------------
              |                                |
SQL Exceptions|                                |

  Exceptions  |  --------------------        |NullPointerException            | Unchecked Exceptions |
              | | Checked Exceptions |       |                                 ----------------------
 I/o Exception|  --------------------        |ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions
              |                              |

                                             |ArithmeticException

  
# Checked Exceptions = Checked exceptions will checked as compile time.
   
   compile time exceptions =
     - file not found exceptions.
     - sql exceptions.
     - intrupted thread.
     - I/o Exceptions.

# UnChecked Exceptions = Unchecked Exceptions will checked as Runtime Exceptions.
   
   Runtime time Exceptions =   
   - ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exceptions.
   - NullPointer Exceptions.
   - Arithmetic Exceptions.
   - NumberFormat Exceptions

 # Exceptions handinding are the five types of block.
 a. Try Block = try block is used to write the Risky code is called as Try Block.

 b. Catch Block = Catch block is used to handle the error inside the try block is called as Catch block.

 c. Throw Block = throw block is used to one throwable object at a time.throw block is written inside
    the block . one throwable object at a time.

 d. Throws Block = Throws block is used to decleration at a time. throws block is written inside the signature
    throws block is multiple decleration at a time.

 e. Finally Block = Finally Block is always Executed is known as Finally Block.

 
# Try block and catch Block =  Try block and catch block is used to try block is write to risky code. agr 
 hum try block ke sath catch block ka use nhi krte h toh program crash and band ho skta h isliye hum 
 try block ke sath catch block ka use krte h kyuki catch block ka work h try block pr joh bhi error aaye 
 usko handle kro. hum one try block and multiple catch block ka use bhi kr skte h.

 # Collections Framework = collections framework is an object that stores a group of element like add,
   remove,insert,acess is known as Collection framework.

  # why Collection framework = collection framework is used to unified Architecture, Build-in DataType,
    Build-in Algorithm, Generics Algorithm,performance, Good Coading.

              |  Array |    | Linked | |TreeSet|  |HashSet|
              |  List  |    |  List  |  -------    -------
               --------      --------  

# collection = collections are the two ways.
 1.List = List are two ways.
    a. ArrayList , b. linkedList (always work same)in the collection.
   ArrayList and linked list =Arraylist and linked list me hum jiss type me data store krege boh usi type me
   output return krega.Arraylist and linked me data indexed,ordered ,duplicate data is allowed. Arraylist is faster the  
     Linked list.
  
2. Set = set are two ways.
   a.TreeSet = Treeset me hum jiss type me data dalte h boh sorted hokr data aata h. treeset is not allow
      ordered,indexed,duplicate data is not allow is called as Treeset.
   b.HashSet = Hashset ka data kuch alag hi aata h kyuki hashmet me hashing always calti rehti h isliye uska 
     output alag hi aata h.

 
# MapSet = means Stores the keys and values.
  MapSet is basically used to treeset and hashset is called as mapset.

 Key points =
 - Mapset is not allow the duplicate keys,and values.
 - but agr keys same h and value different h toh value override hogi.

  # FileHandling = Findhandling is used to store the permanent storage is called as FileHandling.
     filehandling are two ways  1. Read , 2. Write  

   #keys points
        filehandling me pehle humko write krna hoga write krne kr liye humko.
        fileOutputstream,objectOutputstream ka use krna hoga.

       Filehandling me jb hum read use krege toh uske liye humko downcasting krna hoga.kyuki hum joh
        file write me use kr rhe h ussko read me use krna padega.downcasting krne ke bd hamara joh  
        error aayega boh aayega serializable usko humko serializable banana pdega.
          fileinputStream,outputInputStream and downcasting krna hoga.
