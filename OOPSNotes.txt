Que - What is OOPs.
Ans - Opps it stands for object oriented programming language.object oriented programming language is used to
 main purpose of real-world problem and real-world entity is called as Object oriented programming language.

#oops are these step follows.
- state.
- Behaviour.
- Identity.
- Responsibility.

# Oops are the four types.
1. Abstraction.
2. Encapsulation.
3. Inheritance.
4. Polymorphism.

1. Abstraction = At the end of the abstraction state of an object is known as Abstraction.
# Why Abstraction= Abstraction is necessary data is used and not necessary data is ignore.//Selective Ignorance.

2. Encapsulation = Encapsulation means binding and hiding togetherly is known as Encapsulation.
   
Behaviour means function.
# Why Encapsulation = State and behaviour is binding.
b.Data is not directly access.
c.State and behaviour are inseperable in real life.
d.behaviour does not exixts the entity.

3.Inheritance = Inheritance as the way of reausing all ready define class is known as Inheritance.Inheritance 
(is a) relation means extends keyword used.

Why Inheritance = Inheritance is used to reausing the class.

                |        |                           
            Memory      Data Inconsistency          
             Waste        |                         
                        System Failure


# Upcasting = means Genralization.
# DownCasting = means Specialization.

4.Polymorphism = Same message has given to genralize things and same behaviour but implement differently is 
known as Polymorphism.
